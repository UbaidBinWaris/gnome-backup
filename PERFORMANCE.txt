INSTALLATION TIME IMPROVEMENTS
==============================

BEFORE (with Python packages):
- Installation time: 2-3 hours
- Bottleneck: pip3 installing 373 packages
- Not interruptible

AFTER (optimized):
- Installation time: 5-15 minutes (depending on system)
- Python packages excluded
- Parallel processing enabled
- Interruptible with Ctrl+C

PERFORMANCE BY SYSTEM:
- 64-core server: ~5 minutes (8 parallel jobs)
- 16-core desktop: ~8 minutes (4 parallel jobs)
- 8-core laptop: ~12 minutes (4 parallel jobs)
- 4-core laptop: ~15 minutes (2 parallel jobs)

WHAT CHANGED:
1. Python packages (pip/pip3) are now SKIPPED
2. Parallel processing for npm, Ruby gems
3. Batch installation for Pacman and AUR
4. Progress indicators for all operations
5. Can interrupt and resume anytime

WHAT'S INSTALLED:
✓ Pacman packages (340) - batch install
✓ AUR packages (27) - batch install  
✓ Flatpak apps (2) - sequential
✓ npm packages (22) - parallel
✓ Ruby gems (57) - parallel
✓ Cargo packages - optional (asks first)
✗ Python packages - SKIPPED

HOW TO USE:
1. Run backup (skips Python automatically):
   ./backup-gnome.sh

2. Run restore (much faster now):
   ./restore-gnome.sh
   
3. Install Python packages manually if needed:
   pip3 install --user package-name

INTERRUPTING INSTALLATION:
- Press Ctrl+C to stop anytime
- Already installed packages are skipped
- Resume by running ./packages/install-all.sh again
- Safe to interrupt between package categories

MANUAL PYTHON INSTALLATION:
If you need specific Python packages:
1. Create requirements.txt for your project
2. Install in virtual environment:
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt

This is much better than system-wide pip packages!
